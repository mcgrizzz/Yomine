## Status

[![GitHub Workflow Status (with event)](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/mcgrizzz/Yomine/test.yml)](https://github.com/mcgrizzz/Yomine/actions/workflows/test.yml)
[![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/mcgrizzz/Yomine/total.svg)](https://github.com/mcgrizzz/Yomine/releases)
    
üöß **This project is under active development and may be buggy.**  
The macOS and Linux binaries have not been extensively tested.

## Quick Start

1. **Download** the latest release for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/mcgrizzz/Yomine/releases)
2. **Set up Anki integration** (optional) - see [Configuration](#setting-up-anki-integration) below
3. **Set up ASBPlayer connection** (optional) - In ASBPlayer, `MISC` -> `Enable WebSocket client`
4. **Load a subtitle file** (.srt) containing Japanese text
5. **Start mining** - click any term to jump to that timestamp in asbplayer

That's it! Yomine will segment the text, rank terms by frequency, and show you vocabulary and expressions to learn.

## Features

- **Vocabulary extraction** from Japanese subtitle files (words and expressions)
- **Frequency-based ranking** to prioritize terms  
- **Anki integration** to filter out words you already know
- **asbplayer integration** for video navigation
- **Term analysis** with readings, part-of-speech, and context sentences

## Installation

### Download Prebuilt Binary (Recommended)

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/mcgrizzz/Yomine/releases)
2. Download the appropriate file for your system:
   - **Windows**: `yomine-*-windows-x64.exe`
   - **macOS**: `yomine-*-macos-universal` (Intel & Apple Silicon)
   - **Linux**: `yomine-*-linux-x64`
3. Run the executable

## Configuration

### Setting Up Frequency Dictionaries

Yomine uses frequency dictionaries to rank vocabulary by importance and improve text segmentation.

**Adding Dictionaries:**
1. In Yomine, go to **File ‚Üí Load New Frequency Dictionaries**
2. Select zip files containing Yomitan-compatible frequency dictionaries
3. Restart when prompted

**Recommended Dictionaries:**
- **[JPDB v2.2 Frequency Kana](https://github.com/Kuuuube/yomitan-dictionaries/?tab=readme-ov-file#jpdb-v22-frequency-kana-recommended)**: For anime/visual novels
- **[BCCWJ](https://github.com/Kuuuube/yomitan-dictionaries/?tab=readme-ov-file#bccwj-suw-luw-combined)**: Based on the Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese
- **[CC100](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_AYh1VtCq0cj1hXtFO15zRuPUUhUCSHD/view?usp=sharing)**: List from Common Crawl data

More dictionaries: [Marv's collection](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xURpMJN7HTtSLuVs9ZtIbE7MDRCdoU29) and [Shoui's collection](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g1drkFzokc8KNpsPHoRmDJ4OtMTWFuXi)

**Note**: Always download frequency dictionaries from trusted sources to avoid corrupted or malicious files. If you can't find a specific dictionary, consider generating your own using tools mentioned in Yomitan's documentation or community guides. You may want to ask around on the [TMW Discord](https://learnjapanese.moe/join/) as well.

### Setting Up Anki Integration

Yomine connects to Anki to filter out terms you already know.

**Prerequisites:**
1. Install the [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) add-on in Anki
   - In Anki: Tools ‚Üí Add-ons ‚Üí Get Add-ons ‚Üí Enter code `2055492159`
   - Restart Anki

**Configuration:**
1. In Yomine: Settings ‚Üí Anki Settings
2. Wait for connection to establish
3. For each note type:
   - Select from dropdown
   - Choose **Term Field** (Japanese word/phrase)
   - Choose **Reading Field** (pronunciation)
   - Click "Add" to save mapping
   
   *Note: Yomine will try to guess the correct fields for you*

## Roadmap

### Completed
- [x] **Anki Integration Customization** 
- [x] **Prebuilt Binaries**

### Planned
- [ ] **Improved Segmentation**: Better text parsing and part-of-speech tagging
- [ ] **More File Types**: Support for eBooks, web pages, etc.
- [ ] **Comprehensibility Estimation**: Sentence and file-level difficulty scoring
- [ ] **Custom Frequency Lists**: Generate dictionaries from your own content
- [ ] **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by part-of-speech, frequency ranges, n+1 sentences

## FAQ

**What is vocabulary mining?** 

It's the process of extracting unknown words and expressions from native content (videos, books, etc.) to create targeted study materials. This approach focuses on vocabulary that's relevant to content you want to understand, rather than studying random word lists.

**How should I use this tool?** 

I prefer post-input mining: after watching a video or episode, I add it to a todo list. Then, whenever I have time, I can review the content and extract terms I want to add to my Anki mining deck. This helps me stay focused on enjoying the content while watching, knowing I can come back to mine vocabulary later.

**Yomine?** 

The name comes from Ë™≠„Åø ("yomi" for reading) + "mine" (as in mining vocabulary).

## Building from Source

**Prerequisites**: 
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) with Cargo
- [asbplayer](https://github.com/killergerbah/asbplayer) (optional, for timestamp navigation)
- Anki (optional, for known vocab filtering)

**Steps:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mcgrizzz/Yomine.git
cd yomine
cargo build --release
cargo run --release
```
